            2. My Story
        </h3>
        <p>
           Always being curious about technologies I also had a dream to serve the world as a Techie. Every journey has its own positive and negative 
           experiences and even I had the same. These 4 years of my Engineering life had given me so many bad as well as good experiences which helped
           me grow as a person each and every day. I am not afraid of failure because that's the first step towards success, I believe.
